        <h2>Welcome to 4 Pics 1 Word</h2>
        <p>In 4 Pics 1 Word, you look at four different pictures and try to figure out the one word that connects them all. Each
            image gives you a clue, and you need to think carefully about what they have in common. You use the given letters to
            form the correct word, and once you guess it right, you move on to the next level. As the levels get harder, you
            challenge yourself to think more creatively and logically.</p>
